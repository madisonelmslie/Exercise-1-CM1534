##Development and design choices 
Wanted to create an easy to read website, with clearly coloured and labelled sections for information and navigation
Navigation easy to use, found at the top and bottom of the page, with clear headings leading you to the correct page 
Layout is not perfect - information is paired with a relevant image, clear colour blocked sections to seperate text for reader, large headings and clear subheadings
Colour choices - went for more muted colours rather than bright, bold colours, did not want it to be overwhelming but rather easy on the eyes, important navigation headers are a bolder colour to make it clearer for user

##Challenges faced
Unsure how to structure the visit.html page as requested in exercise instructions
Not sure if the location map works correctly - seems to work sometimes for the correct coordinations and then other times not 
Images were a bit tricky - used the image link rather than have them saved in an 'images' file, otherwise the alt text would show up instead
html and css are just in one file rather than seperate to eachother
